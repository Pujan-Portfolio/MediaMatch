<p align="center"> Show Swiper is a web application that suggests media based off of the user's inputted genre and media preferences. The application utilizes <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US">The MovieDB API</a> to access media information. The webapplication is made using Python, Flask, Javascript, HTMl, and CSS. A user can create or log into an exisiting account for the application that is linked to a MongoDB server to store all of the collected information. The web applicaiton will allow a user to choose or exclude certain genres and use this information to access the API and get lists of media to recommend to the user. The user will be able to either choose to "Watch" or "Not Watch" the recommended media where it will then be stored into users database to be accessed later. The user has the ability to remove movies off of their "Watch" or "Do Not Watch" lists whenever they would like and gain futher information about those movies through The MovieDB website.
